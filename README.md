Overview: 
The Auslan Gesture Translator is a project completed by Fletcher Adams, Lachlan Khor, and Alexei Delinicolis. This software application is designed to assist individuals in translating and interpreting Auslan (Australian Sign Language) gestures into written text and vice versa. The Auslan Gesture Translator aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who do not understand Auslan.
